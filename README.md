# TRAVELLING. TRACKING.
An interactive project that places the viewer in the position of a London train station. Using the latest technologies, they must keep track of the train departures while using their face to scan the top-down surveillance feed of the station for security. 

A webcam is required for this project to control the surveillance camera. In reality, who's tracking who? Can the task really be safe when the data from the webcam is continuously being feed to the system? 

In a sense, both the spectator and the people of the station are going through the same struggle.

# INSPIRATION
The project was initially inspired by the display boards in Waterloo station. I was fascinated by the way they collected data and organised it well-enough to create these dynamic boards of information that we place our trust in. I also wanted to see how close I could get to recreating their look in P5js.

The introduction of a surveillance camera scanning the area and pointing out members of the public is inspired by the conflicts we face in choosing between convenience and privacy. This came to me after reading into the idea of the Quantified Self. Whereas there may be a benefit in providing our data to personalise our experiences, learn more about ourselves and optimise every part of our lives, I remain skeptical of just how much data is collected by these companies, where this data is exchanged and what is done with it. 

The introduction of face controls poses this dilemma directly to the spectator. Is it really worth having to exchange your privacy for more convenient controls? For the passengers, is it really worth being pinpointed, marked and recorded so they could use this train station?

# PROGRAMMING CHALLENGES
The biggest obstacle in this project was time. I ran out of time to further polish the project and make it feel even more like a system through graphics, sound and maybe a few elements of animation. I also would have loved to incorporate a ml5.js library into this project and feed it CCTV footage for a more interesting effect that expands upon my project, but ran out of time to do so.

For this project, I got to expand my skills on object-oriented programming further to simplify the structure of my code. I also gained confidence in using the windowWidth and windowHeight variables to better align my elements.

This was my first time using a library for a project. The process of incorporating clmtrackr was a bit confusing at first, especially since I wanted to have the tracking interact with the variables of my project. I managed to figure this out through the documentation and by looking for inspiration from the face-like coding example in the GIT coding for the arts repository.

# CONCLUDING REMARKS
I'm rather unsatisfied by the end product, but what I have so far seems to have pushed me to use my skills to the best of my ability. I learned how to better align my elements, for example, and I also learned how to incorporate a library into my project to achieve greater effects. I would say I'm starting to get a bit more confident about using object-oriented programming for my code as well.
